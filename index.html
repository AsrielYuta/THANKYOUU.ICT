          Hello po sir Alex! 
 

I just want to say that I am very grateful to be your student kahit po kasi mahirap ang subject TLE -ICT is nagawa ninyo po itong madali sa tulong ng inyong gabay, pagtitiis at pagsuporta sa amin, kahit na maingay at magulo ang klase namin minsan ay napagtitiisan ninyo sa mahigit buwan po nating pagsasama ay marami kaming natutunan sa inyo bilang isang napakahusay at bukod tanging guro ng computer. Sa bawat output po na iniwawasto ninyo nararamdaman ko ang inyong  suporta at seriousness. Mabait po kayo sa amin pero sa huling pagkikita po sana natin na buong klase ay may mumunting huling lang sana po kaming nais sabihin na sana po ay madalas po kayong ngingiti at magiging laging masaya.

         thank you for being our greatest mentor, fixing our mistakes, correcting our errors, and making sure our codes (and our attitudes üòÖ) are in the right format. You might be strict, but that‚Äôs exactly what helped us improve and stay focused. I really learned a lot from your class, and I‚Äôll honestly miss your lessons and maybe even the pressure of trying not to get an ‚Äúerror‚Äù from you.

Wishing you all the best, sir alex! You‚Äôll always be part of our main function in this journey.
